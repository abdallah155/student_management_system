Task: Building a Student Management System

You have been assigned the task of building a Student Management System using Python. The system should incorporate the concepts of Python basics, error handling, logging, and object-oriented programming (OOP). Here are the requirements for the system:

1. Python Basics:
   - Implement a command-line interface (CLI) for the student management system.
   - Provide options for adding new students, displaying student information, and updating student details.
   - Use appropriate data structures and algorithms to store and retrieve student data.
   - Ensure proper input validation and error handling for user interactions.

2. Error Handling:
   - Implement robust error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions and unexpected scenarios.
   - Use try-except blocks to gracefully handle errors and provide relevant error messages to the user.
   - Handle input errors, file handling errors, and any other potential exceptions that may occur during the execution of the program.

3. Logging the Errors:
   - Utilize the logging module in Python to log errors and other significant events during the execution of the student management system.
   - Configure the logger to save logs to a file and provide a timestamp for each log entry.
   - Include different log levels (e.g., info, warning, error) based on the severity of the events.

4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
   - Design and implement appropriate classes and objects to represent students in the system.
   - Create a Student class with attributes such as name, age, grade, and contact information.
   - Implement methods within the Student class to handle common operations like updating student details.
   - Utilize inheritance and encapsulation principles to organize and structure the code effectively.

Your task is to build the Student Management System according to the given requirements, ensuring that the system adheres to Python basics, incorporates error handling and logging mechanisms, and follows OOP principles. Remember to test your system thoroughly and handle any potential edge cases or exceptions that may arise during its usage.

Finally, implement 2 functions (calculate average of grades, get the student/students who has/have the highest grade and print his/them information)
